#FizzBuzzImproved
In this program we will ask the user to enter a number and than it will put the number in a for loop and start the program and the program works like this:
If the remainder of the user number after division with 3 and 5 equal 0 output FuzzBuzz.
If the remainder of the user number after division with 3 only equal 0 output Fuzz.
If the remainder of the user number after division with 5 only equal 0 output Buzz.
If none of the above worked just output the user number
